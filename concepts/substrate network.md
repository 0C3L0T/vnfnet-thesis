A substrate network, in the context of computer networking and distributed systems, refers to the underlying physical or virtual network infrastructure on which higher-level services, applications, or virtual networks are built.

Here's a breakdown of the term:

1. **Underlying Infrastructure**: The substrate network consists of the actual physical or virtual network components such as routers, switches, cables, servers, and other networking equipment. These components form the foundation upon which various network services and applications operate.
    
2. **Support for Higher-Level Services**: The substrate network provides the necessary connectivity and resources to support higher-level services and applications. These could include traditional services like data transmission, voice communication, and video streaming, as well as newer services like cloud computing, virtualization, and software-defined networking (SDN).
    
3. **Abstraction Layer**: In some cases, the substrate network may provide a level of abstraction to higher-level services, hiding the complexity of the underlying infrastructure. This abstraction allows developers and administrators to focus on building and managing services without needing detailed knowledge of the underlying network hardware or configurations.
    
4. **Resource Allocation and Management**: The substrate network may also be responsible for allocating and managing network resources such as bandwidth, latency, and quality of service (QoS). This involves tasks like routing traffic, load balancing, congestion control, and ensuring high availability and reliability of network services.
    
5. **Virtualization and Overlay Networks**: In modern networking environments, substrate networks often support virtualization and overlay technologies that enable the creation of multiple logical networks or network slices on top of the physical infrastructure. These virtual networks can be customized and isolated to meet the specific requirements of different applications or tenants.
    

Overall, the substrate network serves as the foundation for building and delivering various network services and applications, providing the necessary connectivity, resources, and management capabilities to support a wide range of use cases in distributed computing environments
