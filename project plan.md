The project plan is submitted via Canvas after it has been approved by the project supervisor(s) (both in the case of an external
project). It takes an average of four pages of A4 and consists of the following parts:

### 2
the context; Describe here the part of the field in which this research takes place. It should be clear from this section how the research question, which will be described later, is positioned within computer science.

### 3
The relevant literature: what is the relevant literature associated with the research question? This often takes the form of a description of the “state-of-the-art”: a summary of results previously achieved by others and on which the research question builds.

### 4
The research question; describe the problem that will be worked on. This often takes the form of a reflection with regard to the “state-of-the-art” just described. As part of the research question, it is also described what the project will deliver: the product that will be delivered at the end, eg the results of a research, the source code of developed software, documentation.

### 5
Methods: how is the research conducted? Which subtasks can be distinguished? For example: extensive literature research, design and implementation of a program, design of an experiment.

### 6
The schedule; Describe how the available time is expected to be spent. It is often difficult to identify all activities in advance, let alone to indicate accurately on the day what will be completed on which date. In general, it is possible to identify a number of phases (eg literature research, design,
implementation, experiments, writing a thesis, etc.) and to make a weekly schedule.
Also consider the interim results, the dependencies that may exist and whether there are critical dependencies that prevent the project from proceeding and what the alternative plan is in that case. A Gantt or Pert chart is often used for this.
